<sup>(this extension only works if your browser uses Chromium - you can edit the source code a bit to make it work with your browser)</sup>

Click on the green button labeled `<> Code` and then click on `Download ZIP`.

If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and find the ZIP file. Then, right click on the downloaded file (the ZIP file) and click on `Extract All...`. Next, do what it says and wait for it to finish extracting. You'll see a new folder after it finishes. (If you're not on Windows, search up "how to extract a ZIP file on `your operating system here`") 

Now, go into Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser) and type in `chrome://extensions`. There, if you find anything called `Developer Mode`, check it so it looks like this:

(It is usually at the bottom left or the top right)

Then, click on `Load Unpacked` and choose the folder you have extracted from the ZIP a few steps ago.

Now, you're done! If it automatically disables the extension for you, just look for the extension named `ROBLOX Tools` and enable it with the little slider that looks like this:

If it is not working, go back to `chrome://extensions` and find the `ROBLOX Tools` extension again. Then, click the small, blue `Errors` button underneath the extension details and make a new Github issue for this repository and send a screenshot!

(In this example, there is no Errors button because it is working fine, but if there was one it would be alongside the `Details Remove Reload`)
